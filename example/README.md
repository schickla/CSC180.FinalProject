# üß™ CVE-2025-27607 Lab: Simulating Python Supply Chain RCE via Dependency Confusion

## üìå CVE Summary

**CVE-2025-27607** refers to a **remote code execution (RCE)** vulnerability in the popular Python logging formatter package: `python-json-logger`. Between **December 30, 2024** and **March 4, 2025**, the package's development dependencies included a now-deleted package:

```
msgspec-python313-pre
```

Because this package was **removed from PyPI**, the name was available for a third party to claim ‚Äî a classic case of **dependency confusion**.

Here is a LinkedIn summary: [CVE-2025-27607](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/0x534c_cybersecurity-pythonloggingvulnerability-activity-7304483858475847680-7MlI/) - its a big deal!

If a malicious actor re-uploaded a fake version of this package, and a developer installed `python-json-logger[dev]` using pip on Python 3.13, the attacker could execute arbitrary code on the victim‚Äôs machine or CI/CD system.

- ‚úÖ **Exploit vector**: Installing dev dependencies (`pip install python-json-logger[dev]`)
- ‚ùó **Impact**: Code execution at install-time via `setup.py`
- üîß **Fixed in**: `python-json-logger` version **3.3.0**

## üß∞ Building Labs from CVEs ‚Äî Prompt Checklist

To create a lab from any CVE, you should gather the following:

### 1. üìÑ Vulnerability Details
- CVE number and description
- Affected software and versions
- Type of vulnerability (e.g., RCE, buffer overflow, XSS)

### 2. üéØ Learning Objectives
- What do students or analysts need to understand?
- What behavior are they trying to reproduce or analyze?

### 3. üõ†Ô∏è Environment Needs
- Docker, VMs, or host machine?
- Any specific language runtimes, package managers, etc.?

### 4. ‚öôÔ∏è Exploit Method
- Will the lab show DoS, RCE, a data leak, etc.?
- Is it safe to simulate in a container?

### 5. üîê Remediation & Mitigation
- How was the bug patched?
- How can students secure the environment post-exploit?

## üß™ Lab: Simulating CVE-2025-27607 in Docker

This lab demonstrates a **simulated RCE** via a hijacked development dependency in a controlled Docker environment.

### üîß What It Does

- Builds a **malicious Python package** that executes code on install.
- Creates a fake PyPI-style local directory.
- Installs the package via pip, simulating what happens if a developer installs untrusted dependencies.
- Confirms the payload was executed by creating a file: `/tmp/pwned.txt`.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ `Dockerfile`

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-rc-slim

# Install build tools and setuptools
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential && \
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# Build malicious package
COPY malicious_pkg /malicious_pkg
WORKDIR /malicious_pkg
RUN python3 setup.py sdist && \
    mkdir -p /local_pypi && \
    cp dist/*.tar.gz /local_pypi/

# Copy and prep the app environment
WORKDIR /app

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  rce-lab:
    build: .
    container_name: rce-lab
```

---

### ‚úÖ Run the Lab

In your terminal, from the root of the lab folder:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

---

### üßæ Expected Output

```
[*] Installing dev dependencies...
[+] RCE achieved! Writing to /tmp/pwned.txt
[*] Installation done.
Hacked by dependency confusion
```

üéâ Success! You've just reproduced a **supply chain RCE vulnerability** using a hijacked dev dependency.

---

## ‚úÖ Mitigation Strategies

- **Pin dependencies** using hashes or specific versions.
- Avoid installing dev/test dependencies in production.
- Use tools like:
  - [`pip-audit`](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/)
  - [`pip install --require-hashes`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#require-hashes)
- Monitor deleted packages in your dependency tree.

---

## üìö Next Steps

- [ ] Add a detection exercise (can students find the backdoor?)
- [ ] Extend to simulate GitHub Actions CI compromise
- [ ] Build a hardened version with signed packages

## üôè Credits

This lab was developed as an educational demonstration of CVE-2025-27607 and is for **training purposes only**.

Always practice responsible disclosure and never publish malicious packages to public repositories.
